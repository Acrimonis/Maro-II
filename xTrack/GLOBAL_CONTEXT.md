## Global Rules
- Avoid PowerShell commands; use Windows CMD commands (e.g., `del` not `Remove-Item`, `dir` not `ls`).
- Auto-refine rule wording for clarity and conciseness on `#rule` add.
- Use apk-build.bat to build APK (runs gradlew assembleDebug).
- **No Côte/Bande or Earth/Water controls anywhere in the UI.** The "Côte" (generate coastline) and "Bande" (regenerate 300m band) buttons are completely removed from the app interface. The Earth/Water icon display in the dashboard is also removed. These exist as ViewModel methods only for programmatic/internal use.
